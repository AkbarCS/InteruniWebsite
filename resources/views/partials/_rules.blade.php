            <p>The rules remain unchanged since last year, with three separate sub-competitions: Cross-Country, Soaring and Progression. We are aiming to make competition open to as many people as possible. For example, ab-initios can get points for taking their first flight in a glider, while more experienced pilots can earn points for soaring. Finally, there are points for XC tasks â€“ for those that really know what they're doing! Full details can be found below.</p>
            <p>Above all, we want everyone to enjoy flying, and have a fantastic week!</p>
			<p>Note that the scoring of the activities may change as it is currently under review.</p>
