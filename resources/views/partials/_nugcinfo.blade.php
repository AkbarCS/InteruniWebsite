        <p> This is one of the oldest university gliding clubs in the United Kingdom. We fly every weekend from Cranwell Gliding Club in Lincolnshire, an hour's drive away from Nottingham. This gliding club is located on the site of RAF Cranwell. In addition, we also organise trips to other gliding clubs including Portmoak in Scotland during the Easter break.</p>
		<p> The club currently has two gliders, a twin seater Acro and a single seater Astir. We also use Cranwell's fleet when there are not enough gliders available for the day or our gliders are unavailable due to maintenance for instance.</p>
		<p> If you would like to know more about this club, feel free to <a href="http://www.nugc.net">visit</a> our website.</p>
