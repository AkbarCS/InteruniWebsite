            <p>All flights uploaded are eligible for the soaring competition, including P2 under instruction. It enables pre-cross-country pilots to claim for flights other than ones where progression is made, and rewards good local soaring with fast climbs.</p>
            <p>The rules for the soaring competition are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>One point is awarded for each minute of flight up to 70 mins.</li>
                <li>Four points will be deducted for each minute of flight over 70 minutes.</li>
                <li>The lowest score which can be recorded is 0 points.</li>
                <li>Two points are awarded for each 100 feet of height gained after the launch, provided the climb is maintained for 500 feet (A climb is defined as 'maintained' provided no logged height point is lower than the closest point which precedes the current one by 30 seconds). Climbs of less than 500 feet do not gain height points.</li>
                <li>An <code>igc</code> trace file must be submitted for a flight to be awarded points. It is the responsibility of each team to make sure a working barograph is carried in each scoring glider.</li>
                <li>Only the best scoring flight for each pilot will be counted on any given day.</li>
                <li>Instructors may fly in scoring gliders and may verbally assist the competitor. They may not take control of the glider at any time, except for safety reasons.</li>
                <li>Should both pilots in a two-seater be potential competitors, one must be named as competitor before launch. If the P2 is named as the competitor, the above rule still applies.</li>
                <li>Any launch method may be used. The launch height should be clearly marked by a dip in the barograph trace. If no dip is recorded to verify the launch height, the first climb will not be counted.</li>
                <li>Should only two or less flights longer than 15 minutes be recorded, then the day is scrubbed by default and no scores are awarded for that day.</li>
            </ol>
